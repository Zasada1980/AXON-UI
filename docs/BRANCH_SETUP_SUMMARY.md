## 🛡️ Recommended GitHub Settings

### Branch Protection for `main`

Navigate to: **Repository → Settings → Branches → Add rule**

#### Required Settings:
1. ✅ **Require pull request before merging**
   - Approvals: 1-2
   - Dismiss stale reviews: Yes

2. ✅ **Require status checks to pass**
   - CI/CD Build
   - TypeScript Check
   - Tests

3. ✅ **Require conversation resolution**

4. ✅ **Restrict who can push**
   - Only maintainers (emergency only)

5. ✅ **Prevent force push**

6. ✅ **Prevent deletion**

## 🔄 Updated Workflow

### Old Workflow (Before)
```bash
feature branch → main (direct merge)
```

### New Workflow (Now)
```bash
1. Create feature from develop:
   git checkout develop
   git checkout -b feat/my-feature

2. Make changes and push:
   git push origin feat/my-feature

3. Create PR:
   Base: develop ← Head: feat/my-feature

4. Merge to develop

5. When ready for release:
   Create PR: develop → main
   (Requires approvals)
```

## 📊 Current Status

### Branches

| Branch | Status | Purpose | Protected |
|--------|--------|---------|-----------|
| **main** | ✅ Clean | Production | ⚠️ Should be |
| **develop** | ✅ Active | Development | Optional |

### Recent Commits

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### For All Team Members

1. **Always work in `develop`**:
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   ```

2. **Create features from `develop`**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/my-feature
   ```

3. **PRs go to `develop`** (not main):
   - Base: `develop`
   - Head: `feat/my-feature`

4. **Never commit directly to `main`**:
   - All changes via PR from `develop`
   - Requires approval

### For Maintainers

1. **Set up branch protection**:
   - Go to GitHub Settings
   - Configure rules for `main`
   - Test with dummy PR

2. **Review release PRs carefully**:
   - `develop` → `main` only when ready
   - Run full test suite
   - Check all quality gates

3. **Maintain clean history**:
   - Use "Squash and merge" for features
   - Tag releases on `main`

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate (Required)

1. **Configure GitHub Branch Protection**:
   - [ ] Go to Repository Settings → Branches
   - [ ] Add protection rule for `main`
   - [ ] Enable required status checks
   - [ ] Require pull request reviews
   - [ ] Test protection with dummy PR

2. **Update Team**:
   - [ ] Notify all contributors of new workflow
   - [ ] Share this summary and guides
   - [ ] Answer questions

3. **Verify Setup**:
   - [ ] Try to push to `main` (should fail)
   - [ ] Create test PR: feature → develop (should work)
   - [ ] Create test PR: develop → main (should require approval)

### Short-Term (Recommended)

1. **Clean Up Old Branches**:
   - [ ] Archive/delete 60+ spark/iteration branches
   - [ ] Remove merged feature branches
   - [ ] Keep only active branches

2. **Set Default Branch**:
   - [ ] Consider setting `develop` as default branch
   - [ ] Or keep `main` as default (for visibility)

3. **Add CI/CD Protection**:
   - [ ] Ensure CI runs on all PRs to `develop`
   - [ ] Require CI success before merge
   - [ ] Add automated checks

### Long-Term (Optional)

1. **Enhance Protection**:
   - Add CODEOWNERS file
   - Require signed commits
   - Add automated deployment checks

2. **Monitor Metrics**:
   - Track PR cycle time
   - Monitor build success rate
   - Review branch health monthly

3. **Continuous Improvement**:
   - Update guides based on experience
   - Refine workflow as needed
   - Gather team feedback
