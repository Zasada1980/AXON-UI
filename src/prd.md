- **Kipling Protocol Integration**: Six-dimension analysis framework (Who, What, When, Where, Why, How) ensuring comprehensive coverage of analytical aspects
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time completeness metrics showing analysis progress across all dimensions

### AI Audit System
- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Four specialized audit agents (Security, Bias Detection, Performance, Compliance) each designed for specific audit domains
- **Configurable Parameters**: Adjustable sensitivity levels, analysis depth, audit scope, and alert thresholds for each agent
- **Audit Session Management**: Real-time monitoring of audit processes with start/stop controls and status tracking
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Detailed audit results with findings categorization, severity assessment, and recommendations

### Project Management
- **Multi-Project Support**: Create, manage, and switch between multiple analysis projects with persistent state
- **Automatic Saving**: All content automatically preserved with last-modified timestamps
- **Export Capabilities**: Generate comprehensive JSON reports containing all analysis data, insights, and audit results

### AI-Powered Insights
- **Context-Aware Analysis**: Generate relevant insights based on content within each analytical dimension
- **Strategic Recommendations**: AI-generated actionable intelligence aligned with the IKR directive
- **Quality Feedback**: Continuous guidance on analysis depth and completeness

## Design Direction

### Visual Tone & Identity
**Emotional Response**: Professional confidence, analytical clarity, intellectual precision, security assurance
**Design Personality**: Serious and sophisticated, conveying expertise and reliability in intelligence analysis and AI verification
**Visual Metaphors**: Clean geometric forms, structured layouts, systematic organization, and security-focused elements reflecting methodical analysis and audit processes
**Simplicity Spectrum**: Structured complexity - rich functionality organized in clear, logical hierarchies with specialized audit interfaces

### Color Strategy
**Color Scheme Type**: Analogous with strategic accents and security indicators
**Primary Color**: Deep blue (oklch(45% 0.15 248)) - conveying trust, intelligence, and analytical depth
**Secondary Colors**: Slate gray variations for supporting elements and hierarchy
**Accent Color**: Orange (oklch(65% 0.18 45)) - drawing attention to insights, key findings, and calls-to-action
**Security Colors**: Additional color coding for audit status (green for success, red for issues, yellow for warnings)
**Color Psychology**: Blue establishes credibility and analytical focus, orange highlights important discoveries, while security colors provide immediate status recognition

### Typography System
**Font Pairing Strategy**: Single font family (Inter) with strategic weight and size variations
**Typographic Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between project titles, dimension headers, content areas, insights, and audit results
**Font Personality**: Inter's modern, legible characteristics support professional analysis work and technical audit reporting
**Typography Consistency**: Consistent scaling and spacing creating visual rhythm throughout the interface including audit modules

### Component Selection & Customization
**Primary Actions**: Prominent buttons for project creation, insight generation, audit execution, and export functions
**Content Organization**: Card-based layout for analytical dimensions and audit agents with clear progress indicators
**Audit Interface**: Specialized controls for agent selection, configuration, and audit management
**Form Design**: Professional textarea and input styling for content entry and agent configuration
**Navigation**: Tab-based organization separating Overview, Kipling Protocol, IKR Directive, and AI Audit
**Progress Visualization**: Progress bars showing completion status across all analytical dimensions and audit processes

### AI Audit Interface Design
**Agent Selection**: Visual cards displaying agent capabilities, current status, and configuration options
**Configuration Panel**: Slider controls for sensitivity, depth, and threshold settings with real-time feedback
**Audit Controls**: Clear start/stop buttons with status indicators and session management
**Results Display**: Structured presentation of audit findings with severity indicators and actionable recommendations

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout
**Attention Direction**: Project headers establish context, tab navigation provides structure, dimension cards organize content, audit status provides security oversight
**Grid System**: Responsive grid adapting from four columns (with audit) on desktop to single column on mobile
**Content Density**: Balanced information presentation avoiding overwhelming complexity while providing comprehensive tools including audit capabilities

## Implementation Considerations
**Scalability Needs**: Support for multiple concurrent analysis projects and audit sessions with efficient data management
**Critical Features**: Persistent storage, reliable auto-save, consistent AI-powered insight generation, and robust audit session management
**Security Requirements**: Secure audit agent configuration storage and audit result preservation
**Success Metrics**: Project completion rates, insight generation frequency, audit execution success rates, and export usage patterns
