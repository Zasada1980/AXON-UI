# AXON Analysis Project - Product Requirements Document

## Core Purpose & Success

**Mission Statement**: AXON is a comprehensive analysis and intelligence platform that implements the IKR (Intelligence, Knowledge, Reasoning) directive using Kipling's protocol to systematically analyze projects, situations, and data through the foundational questions: Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How.

**Success Indicators**:
- Users can efficiently conduct systematic analysis using the Kipling framework
- Complex information is broken down into digestible, actionable insights
- Analysis results are presented in clear, hierarchical structures
- Data connections and relationships are visually represented
- Users can export and share analysis findings

**Experience Qualities**: Analytical, Systematic, Professional

## Project Classification & Approach

**Complexity Level**: Complex Application (advanced functionality, multi-dimensional analysis, data visualization)

**Primary User Activity**: Analyzing - Users primarily engage in systematic information analysis, pattern recognition, and insight generation

## Thought Process for Feature Selection

**Core Problem Analysis**: Organizations and individuals need a structured approach to analyze complex situations, projects, or data sets. Traditional analysis methods often miss critical connections or fail to systematically explore all dimensions of a problem.

**User Context**: Analysts, project managers, researchers, and decision-makers need to conduct thorough investigations and present findings in a structured, professional manner.

**Critical Path**: 
1. User initiates new analysis
2. System guides through Kipling protocol framework
3. User inputs information for each dimension (Who, What, When, Where, Why, How)
4. System processes and connects information
5. Visual analysis dashboard presents insights
6. User can drill down, modify, and export results

**Key Moments**:
1. First interaction with the analysis framework - must feel intuitive and professional
2. Data input process - should guide users without feeling restrictive
3. Results presentation - must clearly show connections and insights

## Design Direction

### Visual Tone & Identity
**Emotional Response**: Professional confidence, analytical clarity, systematic precision
**Design Personality**: Serious yet approachable, intelligent, trustworthy, methodical
**Visual Metaphors**: Network connections, analytical instruments, research laboratory aesthetics
**Simplicity Spectrum**: Rich interface that reveals complexity progressively

### Color Strategy
**Color Scheme Type**: Professional blue-based palette with complementary accents
**Primary Color**: Deep blue (#1e40af) - conveys trust, intelligence, and professionalism
**Secondary Colors**: 
- Slate gray (#475569) - for supporting information and backgrounds
- Emerald (#059669) - for positive insights and completed analysis
**Accent Color**: Orange (#ea580c) - for critical insights and call-to-action elements
**Color Psychology**: Blues promote analytical thinking, grays provide neutral backdrop, green signals progress, orange draws attention to important findings
**Color Accessibility**: All combinations meet WCAG AA standards (4.5:1 contrast minimum)
**Foreground/Background Pairings**:
- Background (white #ffffff) + Foreground (dark slate #1e293b) = 16.75:1 ✓
- Card (light gray #f8fafc) + Card foreground (dark slate #1e293b) = 15.89:1 ✓
- Primary (deep blue #1e40af) + Primary foreground (white #ffffff) = 8.59:1 ✓
- Secondary (slate #475569) + Secondary foreground (white #ffffff) = 7.25:1 ✓
- Accent (orange #ea580c) + Accent foreground (white #ffffff) = 4.51:1 ✓

### Typography System
**Font Pairing Strategy**: Single professional font family with multiple weights for hierarchy
**Typographic Hierarchy**: 
- H1: 2.25rem (36px) - Major section headers
- H2: 1.875rem (30px) - Analysis category headers
- H3: 1.5rem (24px) - Subsection headers
- Body: 1rem (16px) - Main content
- Small: 0.875rem (14px) - Supporting information
**Font Personality**: Clean, readable, professional, authoritative
**Readability Focus**: Optimized for scanning large amounts of analytical text
**Typography Consistency**: Consistent spacing ratios (1.5x line height for body text)
**Which fonts**: Inter (primary) - exceptional readability and professional appearance
**Legibility Check**: Inter excels in analytical contexts with clear character distinction

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout
**Attention Direction**: Left-to-right reading pattern with clear visual funnel to key insights
**White Space Philosophy**: Generous spacing to prevent cognitive overload during analysis
**Grid System**: 12-column responsive grid with consistent 24px base spacing unit
**Responsive Approach**: Mobile-first with progressive enhancement for desktop analysis tools
**Content Density**: Balanced - detailed enough for professional use, spacious enough for clarity

### Animations
**Purposeful Meaning**: Subtle transitions that guide attention and indicate system processing
**Hierarchy of Movement**: 
1. Data loading and processing indicators (highest priority)
2. Section transitions and reveals (medium priority)  
3. Micro-interactions for user feedback (lowest priority)
**Contextual Appropriateness**: Professional, subtle animations that enhance rather than distract

### UI Elements & Component Selection
